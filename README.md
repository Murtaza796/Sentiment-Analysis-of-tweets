# Sentiment-Analysis-of-tweets
Here, we have a data set, and the program performs sentiment analysis of tweets and shows various reactions and algorithm scores.
So, in the fullfinal.py, we are executing the naive bayes and logistic regression, also we are providing an emoji mapping.
and in the XGBOOSTfinal.py, we are executing the xg booster algorithm seperately due to some techinical issues on my devices.
